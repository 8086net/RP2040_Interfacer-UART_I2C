Raspberry Pi Pico USB-UART and I2C Bridge
=================================
This project converts the Raspberry Pi Pico(or any RP2040) into a USB to 6 UART and I2C board with activity LEDs.

Supporting hardware, the "PicoUART6" is available on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/32981/) and [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/204561279568).

The 6 USB UART are compatible with the builtin USB CDC class drivers in Linux, macOS, and >= Windows 10.

The I2C interface requires an i2c-tiny-usb driver. On Linux copy the "90-PicoUART6.rules" file into "/etc/udev/rules.d/", run "sudo udevadm control --reload" and then unplug/replug the Pico. Running "i2cdetect -l" will then show the i2c-tiny-usb bus you need to use in your application.

History
----------

This expands [JoeSc's](https://github.com/JoeSc/pico-sexa-uart-bridge) project to add activity LED for each UART which itself expands [Noltari's](https://github.com/Noltari/pico-uart-bridge) project to add 4 additional UARTs using the pico PIOs. And expands on [harrywalsh's](https://github.com/harrywalsh/pico-hw_and_pio-uart-gridge) project to provide better SEO and remove some data loss when using all 6 UARTs concurrently.

It then has [Nicolai-Electronics's](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/rp2040-i2c-interface) project for i2c-tiny-usb support merged in.
